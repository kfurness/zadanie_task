## Synopsis

This project shows how to create tabular data that includes pagination, ability to control number of rows rendered, user name filtering, and ascending and descending sorting in columns. By utilizing firebase, one can add another row of data.
To help with this project I have used:
* React
* Bootstrap
* React-Bootstrap-Table
* Webpack
* package.json
* Firebase
* SASS (although not used to its full potential)

## Motivation

This was created based on a coding task I received. I was also wanted to try out the "react-bootstrap-table" library that is quite helpful!
